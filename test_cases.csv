SETUP-009,Wrong Wi-Fi password shows explicit error and retry,P1,S3 Provisioning,"SSID visible","1) Select SSID; 2) Enter wrong password; 3) Submit; 4) Wait <=60s","Provisioning fails with a clear authentication error and user can retry without re-pairing.","App shows stable error reason (auth failure) and retry option; robot does not remain in 'connected' state"
SETUP-010,5GHz-only network rejected with guidance,P2,S3 Provisioning,"Only 5GHz available OR robot supports 2.4GHz only","1) Attempt to provision using a 5GHz-only SSID","App blocks or fails fast with clear guidance (2.4GHz required).","App provides stable failure reason (unsupported band); provisioning does not proceed into a long spinner"
SETUP-011,Hidden SSID manual entry supported or explicitly rejected,P2,S3 Provisioning,"Hidden SSID; user knows SSID + password","1) Choose manual/hidden network entry; 2) Enter SSID + password; 3) Submit; 4) Wait <=90s","Robot either connects successfully OR app shows an explicit unsupported path (no silent fail).","Either robot shows connected state OR app shows a stable failure reason tied to hidden SSID handling"
SETUP-012,Firmware update completes and version increments,P0,S4 Firmware,"Robot online; update available; battery sufficient or docked","1) Start firmware update; 2) Wait for completion/reboot; 3) Reconnect","Update completes successfully and robot reports the new firmware version.","Robot update status transitions to completed; firmware version reported after reboot matches target version; app resumes setup"
SETUP-013,Firmware update blocked on low battery,P1,S4 Firmware,"Battery low; robot not docked; update available","1) Attempt firmware update","App blocks update and prompts user to dock/charge before continuing.","App shows stable failure reason (low battery); update does not start until charging is detected"
SETUP-014,Edge: network drop during account binding doesn’t create ghost device,P0,S7 Resilience,"Provisioning OK locally; simulate internet drop during binding","1) Provision Wi-Fi; 2) Drop internet right after robot joins Wi-Fi; 3) Let binding fail/timeout; 4) Restore internet; 5) Retry","Retry completes binding and user ends up with a single usable device in the account.","Backend shows only one device record tied to the account; binding status reaches completed after retry; app proceeds without factory reset"
SETUP-015,App killed mid-provisioning resumes to correct step,P1,S7 Resilience,"Provisioning screen open","1) Start Wi-Fi provisioning; 2) Force close app; 3) Relaunch; 4) Return to setup flow","Setup resumes at the correct step and keeps the same device context.","App restores setup session state (device selected + current step); user is not forced to restart from pairing unless session expired"
SETUP-016,Edge: robot reboot during provisioning/update recovers,P0,S7 Resilience,"Auto-update enabled or reboot injected mid-provisioning","1) Start provisioning; 2) Trigger robot reboot mid-step; 3) Observe recovery; 4) Continue setup","System recovers to a known state and setup can continue without manual reset.","Robot returns to a consistent setup mode (resume or restart provisioning); update (if triggered) completes; no duplicate device record appears"
SETUP-017,Timezone/region saved and reflected in timestamps,P2,S5 Config,"Robot online","1) Set region; 2) Set language; 3) Set timezone; 4) Save","Settings persist and are used in run history timestamps.","Robot/app config reflects region/language/timezone after save; run timestamps align with selected timezone"
SETUP-018,Edge: two phones concurrent setup enforces setup lock,P0,S7 Resilience,"Phone A + Phone B same account; robot READY","1) Start setup on Phone A; 2) Attempt setup on Phone B for same robot","Second setup attempt is blocked until the first completes/cancels/times out.","Phone B receives a stable 'setup in progress/locked' error; only one active setup session exists at a time"
SETUP-019,Edge: captive portal detected (connected but no internet),P1,S3 Provisioning,"SSID uses captive portal; DHCP OK; internet blocked","1) Provision Wi-Fi; 2) Continue setup","Robot may connect to Wi-Fi locally but app detects no internet and blocks cloud-dependent steps with guidance.","Robot reports no-internet (or cloud connectivity check fails); app shows stable failure reason and suggests switching networks"
SETUP-020,First cleaning run completes with map + run summary,P0,S6 First run,"Robot online; firmware current; bin installed; map not created yet","1) Start first cleaning run; 2) Verify robot starts cleaning; 3) Let it complete or stop after a reasonable time; 4) Confirm end state","Cleaning run completes, map is created/saved, and run summary is recorded.","Robot status shows cleaning start then completion; map creation state indicates saved/ready; run summary exists in app/backend history"
